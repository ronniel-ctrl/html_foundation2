            <h4>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h4>
            <p> Is a style sheet language used for specifying the <strong>presentation</strong> and <strong>styling</strong> of 
            a document written in a markup language such as<strong> HTML</strong> or <strong>XML</strong> (including XML dialects such as <strong>SVG, 
            MathML or XHTML</strong>). <strong>CSS</strong> is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside <strong>HTML</strong> and 
            <strong>JavaScript.</strong>
            <p><strong>CSS</strong> is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including <strong>layout, colors,</strong> and <strong>fonts.</strong>
            This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility 
            and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share 
            formatting by specifying the relevant <strong>CSS</strong> in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition 
            in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between 
            the pages that share the file and its formatting</p>

            <p>The <strong>CSS</strong> specifications are maintained by the <strong><a  href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank"> World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</a></strong> Internet media type 
            (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free 
            CSS validation service for CSS documents.</p>

        <h3>Style Sheet</h3>
            <p>A<strong> Style Sheet</strong> consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.</p>

        <h3>Selector</h3>

            <p>In CSS, <strong>Selectors </strong> declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.</p>

            <h3>Selector Types</h3>

            <p><strong>Selectors may apply to the following:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>All elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
            <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li>
            <li> id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix 
            e.g. #id</li>
            <li>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix 
            e.g. .classname (the phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element 
            classes—specified with the HTML class attribute—is a markup feature that is distinct from 
            browsers' CSS subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles; 
            see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the Web content model)</li>
            <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
            <li>Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, 
            hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID 
            may only be applied to a single element.</li>
        </ul

        </p><br>

        <h3>Pseudo-classes</h3>

            <p><strong>Pseudo-classes</strong> are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained 
            in the document tree.

            <p>One example of a widely used pseudo-class is <strong>:hover</strong>, which identifies content only when the user 
            "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector 
            as in a<strong>:hover</strong> or <strong>#elementid:hover</strong>.</p>

            A <strong>Pseudo-class</strong> classifies document elements, such as <strong>:link</strong> or <strong>:visited</strong>, whereas a pseudo-element makes 
            a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as <strong>::first-line</strong> or <strong>::first-letter</strong>.[6] Note the distinction 
            between the double-colon notation used for pseudo-elements and the single-colon notation used for 
            pseudo-classes</p><br>

        <h3>Combinators</h3>

            <p>Multiple simple selectors may be joined using <strong>combinators</strong> to specify elements by <strong>location, element 
            type, id, class,</strong> or <strong>any combination</strong> thereof. The order of the selectors is important.</p>

            <p> For example, 
            <strong><i> div </i> 
            <i>.myClass {color: red;}</i></strong> applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas 
            <strong><i>.myClass div {color: red;}</i></strong> applies to all div elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not 
            to be confused with concatenated identifiers such as <strong><i>div.myClass {color: red;}</i></strong> which applies to div 
            elements of class myClass.</p><br>

        <h3>Declaration Block</h3>

            <p>A <strong>Declaration block</strong> consists of a pair of braces (<strong>{ }</strong>) enclosing a semicolon-separated list of declarations.</p><br>

        <h3>Properties</h3>

            <p><strong>Properties</strong> are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a set of possible values. Some Properties can affect any type of element, and other apply only to particular groups of elements.</p><br>

        <h3>Values</h3>

            <p><strong>Values</strong> may be keywords, such as "<i>center</i>" or "<i>inherit</i>", or numerical values, such as 200px (200 pixels), 
            50vw (50 percent of the viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent element's width).</p>

            <p><strong>Color values</strong> can be specified with keywords (e.g. "red"), hexadecimal values (e.g. #FF0000, also 
            abbreviated as #F00), RGB values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. rgb(255, 0, 0)), RGBA values that specify both 
            color and alpha transparency (e.g. rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)), or HSL or HSLA values (e.g. hsl(000, 100%, 50%), 
            hsla(000, 100%, 50%, 80%)).</p>

            <p><strong>Non-zero numeric values</strong> representing linear measures must include a length unit, which is either an 
            alphabetic code or abbreviation, as in 200px or 50vw; or a percentage sign, as in 80%. Some units – cm 
            (centimetre); in (inch); mm (millimetre); pc (pica); and pt (point) – are absolute, which means that the 
            rendered dimension does not depend upon the structure of the page; others – em (em); ex (ex) and px 
            (pixel)[clarification needed] – are relative, which means that factors such as the font size of a parent
            element can affect the rendered measurement. These eight units were a feature of CSS 1[14] and 
            retained in all subsequent revisions. The proposed CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 will, if adopted 
            as a W3C Recommendation, provide seven further length units: ch; Q; rem; vh; vmax; vmin; and vw.</p><br>
