                    <p>A <strong>Web Framework (WF)</strong> or <strong>Web Application Framework (WAF)</strong> is a software framework that is designed to support the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application" target="_blank"> web applications</a> including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_resource" target="_blank"> web services</a>, web resources, and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API" target="_blank"> web APIs.</a></strong> Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank"> World Wide Web. Web</a> frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development" target="_blank"> web development.</a> For example, many web frameworks provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)" target="_blank"> libraries</a> for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, and they often promote code reuse.[1] Although they often target development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page" target="_blank"> dynamic web sites</a>, they are also applicable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page" target="_blank"> static websites.</a>-[2]</p><br>

                <h3>Types of framework architectures</h3>

                    <img src="images/IMG_1-3.png" width="500" height="350" alt="framework pic">
                    <p>Most web frameworks are based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank"> model–view–controller</a> (MVC) pattern</p>

                    <img src="images/Img-2@2x.png" width="500" height="350" alt="mvc">

                    <h3>Model–view–controller (MVC)</h3>

                    <p>Many frameworks follow the MVC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern" target="_blank"> architectural pattern</a> to separate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model" target="_blank"> data model</a> into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_rule" target="_blank"> business rules</a> (the "controller") and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface" target="_blank"> user interface</a> (the "view"). This is generally  considered a good practice as it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank"> modularizes code</a>, promotes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse" target="_blank"> code reuse</a>, and allows multiple interfaces to be applied. In web applications, this permits different views to be presented, for example serving different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page" target="_blank"> web pages</a> for mobile vs. desktop browsers, or providing machine-readable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service" target="_blank"> web service</a> interfaces.</p>


                <h3>Push-based vs. pull-based</h3>

                    <p>Most MVC frameworks follow a push-based architecture also called "action-based". These frameworks use actions that do the required processing, and then "push" the data to the view layer to render the results.[5] An alternative to this is pull-based architecture, sometimes also called "component-based". These frameworks start with the view layer, which can then "pull" results from multiple controllers as needed. In this architecture, multiple controllers can be involved with a single view.</p><br>

                <h3>Three-tier organization</h3>

                    <img src="images/three-tier.png" width="350" height="450" alt="tier">
                    
                    <P>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Three-tier_architecture" target="_blank"> three-tier organization</a>, applications are structured around three physical tiers: client, application, and database.The database is normally an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS" target="_blank"> RDBMS</a>. The application contains the business logic, running on a server and communicates with the client using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP" target="_blank"> HTTP</a>.[10] The client on web applications is a web browser that runs HTML generated by the application layer. The term should not be confused with MVC, where, unlike in three-tier architecture, it is considered a good practice to keep business logic away from the controller, the "middle layer".</p>

                <h3>Framework applications</h3>

                        <p>Frameworks are built to support the construction of internet applications based on a single programming language, ranging in focus from general purpose tools such as Zend Framework and Ruby on Rails, which augment the capabilities of a specific language, to native-language programmable packages built around a specific user application, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank"> content management systems</a> (CMS), some mobile development tools and some portal tools.</p><br>

                <h3>General-purpose website frameworks</h3>

                        <p>Web frameworks must function according to the architectural rules of browsers and protocols such as <strong>HTTP</strong>, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol" target="_blank"> stateless</a>. Webpages are served up by a server and can then be modified by the browser using JavaScript. Either approach has its advantages and disadvantages.

                        Server-side page changes typically require that the page be refreshed, but allow any language to be used and more computing power to be utilized. Client-side changes allow the page to be updated in small chunks which feels like a desktop application, but are limited to JavaScript and run in the user's browser, which may have limited computing power. Some mix of the two is typically used. Applications which make heavy use of JavaScript and only refresh parts of the page, are called single-page applications and typically make use of a client-side JavaScript web framework to organize the code.</p><br>

                <h3>Why should you learn JavaScript?</h3>
                    <p>Learning JavaScript is important for several reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                         <li>Foundation of Web Development</li>
                         <li>Fundamental Skill of a Web Developer</li>
                         <li>Create and customize content on the Web</li>
                         <li>Career Opportunities</li>
                         <li>Business Solutions</li>
                    </ul>
                        <p>By doing a lot of practice, you will definitely experience errors and bugs in your code, but don't 
                        worry, you will overcome them all!</p>
